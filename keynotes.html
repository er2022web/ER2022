                <h4><u>Conceptual Modelling in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and
                  Quantum Computing</u></h4>
                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: smaller;">
                  <p>Models are not true, but some are useful. Models are either used as mental constructs by
                    individuals or they are used by groups as social constructs. Conceptual modeling has always
                    focused on socially constructed, explicit representations that are useful for gaining shared
                    understanding of an affair or even for designing and implementing technical systems, most
                    of all information systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>For mental representations of individuals, the working hypothesis of neuroscience is that
                      mental representations are embossed into neural structures and ultimately into electric
                      signals. Socially constructed conceptual models require explication by representations
                      governed by some shared conceptual-modelling grammar (Wand &amp; Weber 2001), i.e., they
                      become social reality by information in a medium.</p>
                    <p>Different phases of conceptual modeling have been conducted in the past decades. Initially,
                      conceptual models were fully controlled and “closed” representations, e.g., frames. This was
                      followed by a phase of conceptual models that are unrestricted (“open”) for capturing the
                      richness of human knowledge in general, most of all ontologies. Statistical models and
                      machine learning models often lack direct connections to individual knowledge and socially
                      constructed knowledge but emerge from data alone. The underlying assumption is that data
                      is taken directly from reality and is therefore objective. Recent discussions on biases and
                      distortions of data raise the question of the social construction of data as well. Current
                      research on explainability and interpretability tries to build bridges between both fields.
                      Hybrid models are an attempt in this direction by trying to merge socially constructed
                      conceptual models with machine learning models. The success of machine learning models
                      has initiated chip design research to develop dedicated chips that can directly support AI
                      processing. This might have repercussions on preferred designs of information systems and
                      machine learning models. Even more advanced are quantum computing and quantum
                      information theory when transforming data representations into quantum representations
                      that are accessible by quantum computing algorithms.</p>
                      <p>In this talk, common aspects between all these fields are discussed and some thoughts on
                        research questions will be presented. A focus will be laid on the interplay between
                        conceptual modeling and machine learning models but also some connections to advanced
                        chip designs and quantum computing are given.</p>

                    professionals and organizations in realizing their digital aspirations: from strategy to realization. His
                    motto is: in an increasingly digital world, you have to put the people first. He has worked in different

                    It is increasingly apparent that data is one of the key assets for many organizations. The corollary is that
                    the data management is becoming more and more important. Bas has helped many organizations in
                    their journey to become more data driven. These projects cover a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from
                    data management processes, organization structures (CDO Office) and training of professionals. The key
                    is to get just enough grip on data in order to create value with data. Recently, Bas has published his
                    experiences in this field with a book: data management - a gentle introduction. This book covers both
                    the theory and practice of this exciting field.

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: smaller;">
                  <p>Digital transformation is a key trend in which data plays a crucial role. As
                    a result of the ongoing digital transformation, in line with the law of requisit
                    variety, I see increased complexity and variety that helps in dealing with the
                    challenges of today. Complexity is not bad in and of itself, as long as we have
                    enough understanding of the organization in order to manage it effectively, and
                    even use it to our advantage.</p>
                    
                    <p>Three real-world cases show that organizations struggle with data/data man-
                    agement. Key questions in this are are: (1) Do we know our data well enough in
                    
                    order to use it? (2) How do we balance “grip on data” with “value creation”?
                    I will argue that effective use of models can help answer these questions. This
                    is not a new position: several scholars have made this claim in the past as well.
                    Very few organizations appear to have a mature modeling capabilitiy, leading
                    to high cost, low agility, and hindering digital transformation. It is intering to
                    ponder how this state of affairs came to be: why is modeling such an under
                    valued skill in light of the fact that both scientific theories as well as heuristic
                    frameworks emphasize it so strongly? Going a step further: why is “theory” such
                    a dirty word in most organizations, up to the point where considering the use
                    of heuritics-based frameworks is alreaddy cause for raised eyebrows and serious
                    discussions? </p>
                    <p>There is no silver bullet that will improve the status quo: if there was, we
                    would have found it by now. I will propose a strategy that combines a fast cycle
                    (learning by doing) and a slow cycle (build the capability, re-learn the value of
                    theory/models) to move forward. This generic approach can only be succesful
                    when tailored to the specific situation in an organization. Last but not least,
                    I will argue that training and experimentation are key enablers: don’t wait to
                    educate people when they are in the field but start already during their university
                    education.</p>

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: smaller;">
                  <p>No complex system can be built without effective modeling. And
                    software systems are complex. Hence, modeling is necessary for building
                    software systems, and a range of models are used for different tasks in the
                    software development process – each playing an important role for that task.
                    The nature and use of models in building a system, however, depends on the
                    nature of the system also – if the system being developed is “hardware” which
                    is costly to change, more rigorous and detailed modeling becomes necessary. If
                    the system being developed is “software” which is easy to change and the cost
                    of change is not high, modeling can be more helpful at higher levels of
                    abstraction helping develop the software solution. Also, while models guide the
                    development of the solution, it may be acceptable to have the final solution
                    diverge from the model. In such situations, reverse engineering models from the
                    solution can also be an useful. Detailed modeling is more appropriate for
                    application domains where errors and changes in the solution are much more
                    expensive. In such cases, domain specific modeling can be useful which may
                    lead to executable models. If models are executable, then the modeling
                    language becomes another programming language and will have to compete for
                    adoption with other programming languages and other approaches for rapid
                    solution development that have emerged. Providing support for integrating
                    generated code with other written code can help in using formal models for
                    parts of the solution.</p>

                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: smaller;">
                  <p>Security attacks form a system of specific flow of computation and data by one or multiple threats. Attacks follow a set of steps in a sequence. Threats work together as threat groups. Holistic 360-degree defenses against APTs often interconnect multiple threat intelligence computation and defense mechanisms. Each of these processes have a graph structure inherent to their execution. Graphs can be used to model spatio-temporal dimensions and flows of different facets of security as well as privacy. In our previous work, we have explored use of graphs and hyper graphs for threat, attack as well as defense modeling. Moreover, we have also explored using modeling threat intelligence as a system of graphs and using graph analytics and graph deep learning in order to predict, infer, extract features and information for assuring holistic security. Such work has been developed in the context of autonomous cars, AI, cloud and edge computing. In this talk, we will also explore how to use NLP and NLU on how to automatically construct such graph models for specific systems under protection/attack.</p>
