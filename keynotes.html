                  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: x-small">Bas is a driven and experienced consultant, trainer, and researcher. The last few years, he has helped
                    professionals and organizations in realizing their digital aspirations: from strategy to realization. His
                    motto is: in an increasingly digital world, you have to put the people first. He has worked in different
                    industries, both in Europe and the United States both as a teacher and consultant. Bas frequently
                    publishes both academic and professional papers and books. He is a frequent speaker at conferences.

                    It is increasingly apparent that data is one of the key assets for many organizations. The corollary is that
                    the data management is becoming more and more important. Bas has helped many organizations in
                    their journey to become more data driven. These projects cover a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from
                    data management processes, organization structures (CDO Office) and training of professionals. The key
                    is to get just enough grip on data in order to create value with data. Recently, Bas has published his
                    experiences in this field with a book: data management - a gentle introduction. This book covers both
                    the theory and practice of this exciting field.

                  <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: x-small">Bas is actively engaged in the community. His academic work (teaching, research) is grounded in the
                    scientific community at Antwerp Management School. He also teaches at Utrecht University of Applied
                    Sciences and is a board member at DAMA Netherlands.

                <h4><u>In an increasingly digital world, you have to put the people first</u></h4>
                <div style="text-align: justify; font-size: smaller;">
                  <p>Digital transformation is a key trend in which data plays a crucial role. As
                    a result of the ongoing digital transformation, in line with the law of requisit
                    variety, I see increased complexity and variety that helps in dealing with the
                    challenges of today. Complexity is not bad in and of itself, as long as we have
                    enough understanding of the organization in order to manage it effectively, and
                    even use it to our advantage.</p>
                    
                    <p>Three real-world cases show that organizations struggle with data/data man-
                    agement. Key questions in this are are: (1) Do we know our data well enough in
                    
                    order to use it? (2) How do we balance “grip on data” with “value creation”?
                    I will argue that effective use of models can help answer these questions. This
                    is not a new position: several scholars have made this claim in the past as well.
                    Very few organizations appear to have a mature modeling capabilitiy, leading
                    to high cost, low agility, and hindering digital transformation. It is intering to
                    ponder how this state of affairs came to be: why is modeling such an under
                    valued skill in light of the fact that both scientific theories as well as heuristic
                    frameworks emphasize it so strongly? Going a step further: why is “theory” such
                    a dirty word in most organizations, up to the point where considering the use
                    of heuritics-based frameworks is alreaddy cause for raised eyebrows and serious
                    discussions? </p>
                    <p>There is no silver bullet that will improve the status quo: if there was, we
                    would have found it by now. I will propose a strategy that combines a fast cycle
                    (learning by doing) and a slow cycle (build the capability, re-learn the value of
                    theory/models) to move forward. This generic approach can only be succesful
                    when tailored to the specific situation in an organization. Last but not least,
                    I will argue that training and experimentation are key enablers: don’t wait to
                    educate people when they are in the field but start already during their university
                    education.</p>
